## Accounts

Accounts are core part of Pockity. An account can be of any of the following types:
- Savings
- Current
- Credit Card
- Debit Card 
- Cash 

These simply affect how transactions are displayed in the app. They support both expenses and reimbursements. 

You can also transfer funds between accounts as outlined in this [tips article](http://127.0.0.1:4000/entries/transfers/).
