## Exports 

You can always export your data in three different formats:

- **Archives**:
  - includes all your data including attachments from expense entries. 

- **JSON**:
  - includes all your data in a JSON format without attachments. 

- **CSV**:
  - this format is limited by a date interval and is interoperable in apps like Excel, Numbers and Open Office.
