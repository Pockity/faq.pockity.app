### What are Recurring Items?

Recurring Items allow you to set up automatic repeating transactions such as loan repayments, subscriptions, utility bills, and other regular expenses. This helps you stay on top of your budget by automatically generating entries on the schedule you define.

### What’s new in the Recurring Details View?

In the [v2025.5 update](https://pockity.app/blog/2025-05-30/release/), the Recurring Details View introduces several enhancements to help you better manage your recurring expenses:

- **Detailed Header:** Displays relevant information about the recurring item, including its schedule, currency, and next due date.
- **Create New Entry Button:** Quickly add a new individual entry directly from the recurring item’s context menu without navigating away.
- **Full Entry List:** View the complete history of all individual entries created from this recurring template, with easy access to edit or delete them.

### How does entry management work with Recurring Items?

- The app automatically generates entries according to the schedule.
- You can manually add or remove specific entries if the automatic schedule requires adjustment.
- The entries list in the details view provides a chronological overview for quick management.
- The update also fixed bugs related to duplicate entries being created inadvertently and cleans up the recurrence rule display for clarity.

### Why use Recurring Items?

Using Recurring Items helps automate your budgeting process, ensuring you never miss tracking regular payments while reducing manual entry effort. It also enables reminders one day in advance so you can maintain sufficient funds.
