In versions of Pockity v2024.9.4 and prior, when ledgers were created, some issues prevented them from being created correctly. 

Versions prior to v2024.2.0 allowed accidentally deleting of read-only system categories like Reimbursements.

To repair such a ledger on iOS, please follow the outlined steps:

1. From the main screen, long press on the ledger name 
2. Tap on the **Edit** context menu item
3. In the *Edit Ledger* screen, tap on **Repair Ledger**

This will check for faults in the ledger, and perform repairs if necessary. Repairs performend, if any, will be displayed to you.
