### Sankey Chart Visualizations

Sankey Charts visualize the flow of funds between your accounts and spending categories. They help you understand where your money comes from and where it goes, showing connections and amounts with easy-to-follow colored streams.

### Where are Sankey Charts available?

Sankey Chart Visualizations are available exclusively on **iPadOS and macOS** versions of Pockity. This feature is not present on iOS.

### Why use Sankey Charts?

- Instantly see the movement of funds between your accounts and categories.
- Spot large or unexpected flows and analyze spending habits visually.
- Compare contributions from different accounts to various categories in a single view.

### How do I view and use Sankey Charts?

1. Open the **Pockity app** on your iPad or Mac.
2. Select the desired **Ledger** from your home/sidebar (e.g., “Primary”).
4. The Sankey Chart appears in the overview, displaying fund flows for the selected ledger.

### How can I customize the Sankey Chart?

- **Adjust Padding:** Use the plus (+) or minus (–) buttons to change the padding between the flow paths for more or less detail.
- **Show Zero Value Items:** Toggle “Show Zero Value Items” to either include or hide categories/accounts with no transactions.
- **Interactivity:** Turn on “Interactive” mode to enable tapping/clicking on flows for highlighting specific paths.
- **Layout:** Use the “Justify” button to change how the chart arranges categories and accounts for better readability.

### Practical Tips

- Hover or tap on a colored flow to see exact transaction amounts and source/target details.
- Use the chart as a visual aid for budget reviews or financial presentations.
- For finer analysis, experiment with filters and layout options.
