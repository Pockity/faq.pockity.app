### Nested and Sub-Categories

Nested and Sub-Categories let you organize your spending categories hierarchically. Instead of a flat list, you can group related categories under a parent category, creating a more structured and meaningful classification of your expenses.

### Why use Nested Categories?

- Improved organization and clearer budget views by grouping similar expenses.
- Easier tracking and reporting on specific spending areas within broader categories.
- Enhanced ability to set budgets on parent categories that roll up across sub-categories (if supported).

### How do I create and manage Nested Categories in Pockity?

1. Open the **Pockity app**.
2. Select **Categories** under the desired ledger.
3. Long-press on an existing category to display its context menu.
4. Tap on **New Sub-Category** to create a new category under this parent category. 
5. Save the category to apply the nesting.
6. The categories list will now display the newly created sub-category next to its parent category.

### Important Notes

- Nested categories are reflected in budget and reporting tools for better expense analysis.
- You can nest multiple levels deep depending on your organizational preference.
- If you move or rename a parent category, its sub-categories will maintain their relationships.
