### Sidebar & Home Screen Updates

The Sidebar and Home Screen in Pockity have been visually and functionally refreshed to make navigation quicker, more intuitive, and visually organized. These updates help users find key features like Entries, Categories, Accounts, and Recurring transactions faster.

### Key features of the updated Home Screen

- **Section Cards:** Instantly see Sections like Drafts, Lunch, Expense Cards, and more at a glance.
- **Ledger Organization:** View and access multiple ledgers directly from the Home Screen, each expanding to display the ledger entries, accounts, categories, and recurring items.
- **Focus Filters:** Easily identify when filtered by Focus mode, with a one-tap option to turn off filtering.

### How do I navigate using the updated Sidebar and Home Screen?

1. When you open Pockity, the Home Screen displays an overview of sections and ledgers.
2. Tap on any card (such as Entries, Categories, Accounts, Recurring) under a ledger to jump directly to that section.
