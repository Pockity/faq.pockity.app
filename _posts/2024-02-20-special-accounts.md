## Special Accounts

Pockity has some reserved keywords which designate accounts as special accounts.

The primary account types are:
- Cash 
- Credit Card 
- Debit Card 
- Savings Account
- Current (Checking) Account

These generally encapsulate the variety of account types available to individuals like yourself and me. 

Some accounts are special though and Pockity enables you to create those using the above:

- An **investment** or **funds** account type: Create a `Savings` account with the numbers `0000`. You can name it whatever makes sense to you. 

- `Cash` account is always a special type. You can use any account number for it. 

- Credit Card accounts are always marked in the appropriate color (depending on your locale) to correctly signify transfer of funds from one account to a credit card account as an expense (analogous to paying the credit card bill).
