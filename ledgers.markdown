## Ledgers

Ledgers are a collection of entries, accounts and categories. 

Upon initial setup, a default **Primary Ledger** is created and it linked to the current locale's currency. 

With [Pockity+](), you can create as many ledgers as you need, each with its own currency. 

#### Segmenting Accounts 

Ledgers are a useful abstraction to segment different accounts into their own collections. 

An example of this is:
- **Primary**: Your personal accounts, and expenses 
- **Business**: Your business accounts and expenses associated with those accounts 
- **Joint**: Your joint accounts with your family or friends
