Recurring templates are a convenient way to automatically generate repeating expenses from existing or new entries. 

To create a new recurring or repeating expense: 
- Create a new entry 
  - Fill in all the necessary details 
  - Tap on **Repeat** (towards end of the list)
  - Fill in details for the recurring template 
  - Tap on **Done** to confirm 

- Long press on an existing entry 
  - Tap on **Repeat**
  - Fill in details for the recurring template 
  - Tap on **Done** to confirm 

### Advantages 

Recurring templates always use the latest currency exchange information for entries with currencies different from the ledger. 

If you have an entry that repeats every week for $25.00, and your ledger's currency is set to **EUR**, it's actual represented value will depend on that day's exchange rate between the two currencies.  

### Limitations 

- Recurring templates *do not* support account transfers or reimbursements.
