## Backups

Pockity automatically takes full archival backups of your data and stores them on your device. 

These backups include:
- Ledgers 
- Entries
  - Attachments from entries
  - Exchanged rate currency information (if applicable)
- Categories
  - Budget Type & Amount information
- Accounts
- Recurring Templates 

Backups do not include any data shared with you by other users. 

If you run into an issue where iCloud stops syncing for some reason, you can always fallback to a backup and restore it. This will clear all existing data and replace it with the backup snapshot, triggering an iCloud re-sync. 

Backups are performed once every 24-hours.
